# Iracing Button Box

Update: 11-25-2021:  Completed the 3D printout files for the enclosure and the arduino code.  The end result is a simple plug and play button box that after you plug it into the free usb port on your computer the buttons are mapped to any functions like on your wheel.  Below are images of the button box in the 3D Freecad and STL files for Cura.

Playing with a button box.  There are many out there and so far there is nothing new other than this is what I have put together and code that I modified to run on the Arduino Leonardo board.  The Leonardo boards make it super easy to make these button boxes as they can work with the Arduino Joystick libraries.  As I progress this project I will update these files.

Originally got this code from the AMStudio Youtube video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Sc4MJ8RPM&t=322s

Much of the functionality is provided by the ArduinoJoyStickLibrary which can be found at: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary


Schematic:

The letters in red are the key mappings and the sketch file is modified to match those.  If you change your key mapping, then modified the sketch to match.  

The black letters and numbers are the Leonardo pin mappings.
