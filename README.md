# Button-Box

Playing with a button box.  There are many out there and so far there is nothing new other than this is what I have put together and code that I modified to run on the Arduino Leonardo board.  The Leonardo boards make it super easy to make these button boxes as they can work with the Arduino Joystick libraries.  As I progress this project I will update these files.
